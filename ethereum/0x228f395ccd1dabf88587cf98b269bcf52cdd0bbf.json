This can easily result in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages. `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an operation overflows. * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.","methods":{}},"userdoc":{"methods":{}}},"settings":{"compilationTarget":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":"SafeMath"},"evmVersion":"istanbul","libraries":{},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"remappings":[]},"sources":{"browser/SafeMath.sol":{"keccak256":"0x04d34b3cd5677bea25f8dfceb6dec0eaa071d4d4b789a43f13fe0c415ba4c296","urls":["bzz-raw://e7e8b526a6839e5ba14f0d23a830387fec47f7043ce01d42c9f285b709a9d080","dweb:/ipfs/QmXmhhFmX5gcAvVzNiDPAGA35iHMPNaYtQkACswRHBVTNw"]}},"version":1},"version":1,"checkPoints":[]}
