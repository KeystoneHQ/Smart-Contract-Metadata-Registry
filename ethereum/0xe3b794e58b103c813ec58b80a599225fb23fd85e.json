These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: * ``` bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\"); ``` * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: * ``` function foo() public {    require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, _msgSender()));    ... } ``` * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}.","methods":{"getRoleAdmin(bytes32)":{"details":"Returns the admin role that controls `role`.
