smart-contract based mechanism to distribute tokens over time, inspired loosely by      Compound and Uniswap.      Distribution tokens are added to a locked pool in the contract and become unlocked over time      according to a once-configurable unlock schedule. Once unlocked, they are available to be      claimed by users.      A user may deposit tokens to accrue ownership share over the unlocked pool. This owner share      is a function of the number of tokens deposited as well as the length of time deposited.      Specifically, a user's share of the currently-unlocked pool equals their \"deposit-seconds\"      divided by the global \"deposit-seconds\". This aligns the new token distribution with long      term supporters of the project, addressing one of the major drawbacks of simple airdrops.
